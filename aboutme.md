# I'm Zijing Gao...

![](/image/self.jpg)

I originally studied Applied Mathematcis to Bachelorâ€™s level and then moved into the machine learning field, completing a Master in Deep Learning, Time Series analysis, and Stochastic Simulation in quantitative finance at Georgetown University in 2020.

I have stayed in the exciting field of machine learning for more than 3 years. I have worked as an intern in several companies in industries including consulting, finance, as well as some research experience.

I just graduate from Georgetown University in May 2020, top 20% best colleges and universities nationwide, where I developped myself in constructing algorithms, building models by cloud computing, and improve model performance in several industries to practice what I learn. This website will be constantly updated if excellent projects, learning materials, and business accmen are collected.

These days, I have specialised in deep learning, which is an exciting area of machine learning that not only allows computers to interpret text, sound and images, but also allow us to predict the stock market in a more statistical and technical way. I am aiming to develop deep learning algorithms to achieve commercial success in the finance industry if possible.

Through me last two working experiences, I can provide various support for the data science team to steadily produce machine learning solutions. I participated in the model establishment, development, and evaluation along with leading in data analysis and visualization tasks.

You can find more details on my projects, resume/CV, blogs, qualifications, and career on various parts of this website!
