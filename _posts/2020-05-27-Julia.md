## Intro to Julia

Work on Julia was started in 2009, by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman, who set out to create a free language that was both high-level and fast. On 14 February 2012, the team launched a website with a blog post explaining the language's mission.

Since the 2012 launch, the Julia community has grown, with over 13,000,000 downloads as of March 2020 (and is used at more than 1,500 universities), The Official Julia Docker images, at Docker Hub, have seen over 4,000,000 downloads as of January 2019. The JuliaCon academic conference for Julia users and developers has been held annually since 2014.

### What is Julia?

__When you search Julia in Google, the first thing that bumps up is never a name or something. It is the Julia language!__

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is an open-source, dynamically-typed, programming language designed to excel at scientific and numerical computing. The Julia programming language can be used for specialized domains such as machine learning, visualization, and data science. Julia can also be used for general-purpose programming.

Created in 2009 by a four-person team and unveiled to the public in 2012, Julia is meant to address the shortcomings in Python and other languages and applications used for scientific computing and data processing. They said:

> "We want a language that’s open source, with a liberal license. We want the speed of C with the dynamism of Ruby. We want a language that’s homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. We want something as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell. Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled."


### Julia vs. Python

Julia was designed from the start for scientific and numerical computation. Thus it’s no surprise that Julia has many features advantageous for such use cases:

- **Julia is fast.** 

  Julia’s JIT compilation and type declarations mean it can routinely beat “pure,” unoptimized Python by orders of magnitude. Python can be made faster by way of external libraries, third-party JIT compilers (PyPy), and optimizations with tools like Cython, but Julia is designed to be faster right out of the gate.

- **Julia has a math-friendly syntax.**

  A major target audience for Julia is users of scientific computing languages and environments like Matlab, R, Mathematica, and Octave. Julia’s syntax for math operations looks more like the way math formulas are written outside of the computing world, making it easier for non-programmers to pick up on.

- **Julia has automatic memory management.** 

  Like Python, Julia doesn’t burden the user with the details of allocating and freeing memory, and it provides some measure of manual control over garbage collection. The idea is that if you switch to Julia, you don’t lose one of Python’s common conveniences.

- **Julia offers superior parallelism.** 

  Math and scientific computing thrive when you can make use of the full resources available on a given machine, especially multiple cores. Both Python and Julia can run operations in parallel. However, Python’s methods for parallelizing operations often require data to be serialized and deserialized between threads or nodes, while Julia’s parallelization is more refined. Further, Julia’s parallelization syntax is less top-heavy than Python’s, lowering the threshold to its use.

- **Julia is developing its own native machine learning libraries.** 

  Flux is a machine learning library for Julia that has many existing model patterns for common use cases. Since it's written entirely in Julia, it can be modified as needed by the user, and it uses Julia's native just-in-time compilation to optimize projects from inside out. 
  
Although Julia is purpose-built for data science, whereas Python has more or less evolved into the role, Python offers some compelling advantages to the data scientist. Some of the reasons “general purpose” Python may be the better choice for data science work:

- **Python uses zero-based array indexing.** 

  In most languages, Python and C included, the first element of an array is accessed with a zero.
  
- **Python has less startup overhead.** 

  Python programs may be slower than Julia programs, but the Python runtime itself is more lightweight, and it generally takes less time for Python programs to start and deliver first results.
  
- **Python has far more third-party packages.** 

  The breadth and usefulness of Python’s culture of third-party packages remains one of the language’s biggest attractions. Again, Julia’s relative newness means the culture of software around it is still small. Some of that is offset by the ability to use existing C and Python libraries, but Julia needs libraries of its own to thrive. Libraries like Flux and Knet make Julia useful for machine learning and deep learning, but the vast majority of that work is still done with TensorFlow or PyTorch.
  
- **Python has millions of users.**
  
  A language is nothing without a large, devoted, and active community around it. The community around Julia is enthusiastic and growing, but it is still only a fraction of the size of the Python community. Python’s huge community is a huge advantage.

    z = 0
    for i=1:50
        z = z^2 + a
    end
    return z
end

for y=1.0:-0.05:-1.0
    for x=-2.0:0.0315:0.5
        abs(mandelbrot(complex(x, y))) < 2 ? print("*") : print(" ")
    end
    println()
end
