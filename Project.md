### How have I organized this page?
This page contains details about projects that I have worked on. In order to help readers get the crux of my work with a single look, I have organized each project using a self-designed template:

- The Project Overview

### Google Stock Price Prediction in Deep Learning

(Stock Price Prediction)[] by Zijing Gao.

__The project overview:__ Utilized an attention-based LSTM neural network to predict the Google stock price.

- Data preparation: It is not that hard to extract financial data from Tiingo. However, 80% of a machine learning project is all about
data preprocessing, right? Even though I was not a big guy in programming, I tried to use PostgreSQL for processing, Python for exploratory data analysis, and R for data analysis. Great effort was spent on such a time-consuming thing! I have to appreciate it for making me familier to what a data analyst should basicaly do.

- Modelling: ![Long Short Term Memory](https://github.com/zg104/Projects/blob/master/Deep%20Learning/LSTM_2.png) – usually just called "LSTMs" – are a special kind of RNN, capable of learning long-term dependencies. They were introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), and were refined and popularized by many people in solving time series problems. Financial data is typically time series data, so I assume that LSTM may be a better choice than the traditional method, such as ARIMA. I constrcuted LSTM networks based on TensorFlow in Python, and spent much effort on the transformation of procecessed data. 

- Evaluation: LSTM is also a kind of neural network, which can be hard to interpret.



LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem. Remembering information for long periods of time is practically their default behavior, not something they struggle to learn!
